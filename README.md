## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS form validation

### What I learned

I learned more in this project than any other I have done before. It was my first time doing form validation and I also faced a lot of problems in positioning  the elements at the desired position. I was making a mess my applying grid and flexbox again and again, So I took a step back, rested and started again by first drawing a very basic outline on a page with pencil , marking dimensions and possible solutins. Then I just completed the whole css part but again faced a lot of issues in js validation part but after spending a lot of time searching and fixing, I completed it.
